This is learning theme from udemy to wordpress theme and plugin development. 
I will include all the codes that i've written through the course i hope it should be helpful for one who already do not buy the course and try best to learn theme development on wordress.

Just setup wordpress into your directory and merge this repo onto it and you are able to follow codes
